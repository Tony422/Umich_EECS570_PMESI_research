/in this implementation, the TDM is represented by a set of 'N' channels, 
each of which contians a 'Data' field and a 'busy' flag that indicates whether the channel
is currently transmitting data. The TDM operates in 'M' cycles, with each cycle consisting
of a loop over the channels in a fixed order. The TDM state is tracked using the 'current_channel',
 and 'tdm_cycle' variables.

 The 'TDM_Step' procedure is is used to advance the TDM to the next channel and cycle. 
 The Send_Data procedure is used to send data on a channel, and the Receive_Data function is 
 used to receive data from a channel. The TDM_Process process is used to perform the 
 TDM operation for a single cycle,
